This is my portfolio. I have added it to github to revise it and make all my changes easier to follow. Hopefully it will land me a job! 
This portfolio is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No Angular, React, extra. I will be making a new one shortly using modern 
web development, but for now, making a few changes to this one should suffice, hopefully.
